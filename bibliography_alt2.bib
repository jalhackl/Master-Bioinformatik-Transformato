 abstract = {In the past analyses of the so-called van der Waals end point problem focused on thermodynamic integration. Here we investigate which of the recommendations, such as the need for soft-core potentials, are still valid when Bennett's acceptance ratio method is used. We show that in combination with Bennett's acceptance ratio method intermediate states characterized by the coupling parameter \textgreek{l} can be replaced by intermediate states in which Lennard-Jones interactions are turned on or off on an {\textquotedbl}atom by atom{\textquotedbl} basis. By doing so, there is no necessity to use soft-core potentials. In fact, one can compute free energy differences without dedicated code, making it possible to use any molecular dynamics program to compute alchemical free energy differences. Such an approach, which we illustrate by several examples, makes it possible to exploit the tremendous computational power of the graphics processing unit.},

@article{Brooks.2009,
 abstract = {CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Mechanics) is a highly versatile and widely used molecular simulation program. It has been developed over the last three decades with a primary focus on molecules of biological interest, including proteins, peptides, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecule ligands, as they occur in solution, crystals, and membrane environments. For the study of such systems, the program provides a large suite of computational tools that include numerous conformational and path sampling methods, free energy estimators, molecular minimization, dynamics, and analysis techniques, and model-building capabilities. The CHARMM program is applicable to problems involving a much broader class of many-particle systems. Calculations with CHARMM can be performed using a number of different energy functions and models, from mixed quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical force fields, to all-atom classical potential energy functions with explicit solvent and various boundary conditions, to implicit solvent and membrane models. The program has been ported to numerous platforms in both serial and parallel architectures. This article provides an overview of the program as it exists today with an emphasis on developments since the publication of the original CHARMM article in 1983.},

@article{Bruckner.2011,
 abstract = {We investigate the relative efficiency of thermodynamic integration, three variants of the exponential formula, also referred to as thermodynamic perturbation, and Bennett's acceptance ratio method to compute relative and absolute solvation free energy differences. Our primary goal is the development of efficient protocols that are robust in practice. We focus on minimizing the number of unphysical intermediate states (\textgreek{l}-states) required for the computation of accurate and precise free energy differences. Several indicators are presented which help decide when additional \textgreek{l}-states are necessary. In all tests Bennett's acceptance ratio method required the least number of \textgreek{l}-states, closely followed by the {\textquotedbl}double-wide{\textquotedbl} variant of the exponential formula. Use of the exponential formula in only strict {\textquotedbl}forward{\textquotedbl} or {\textquotedbl}backward{\textquotedbl} mode was not found to be competitive. Similarly, the performance of thermodynamic integration in terms of efficiency was rather poor. We show that this is caused by the use of the trapezoidal rule as method of numerical quadrature. A systematic study focusing on the optimization of thermodynamic integration is presented in a companion paper.},

@article{Bruckner.2011b,
 abstract = {We attempt to optimize the efficiency of thermodynamic integration, as defined by the minimal number of unphysical intermediate states required for the computation of accurate and precise free energy differences. The suitability of various numerical quadrature methods is tested. In particular, we compare the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, Gauss-Legendre, Gauss-Kronrod-Patterson, and Clenshaw-Curtis integration, as well as integration based on a cubic spline approximation of the integrand. We find that Simpson's rule and spline integration are already significantly more efficient that the trapezoidal rule, i.e., correct free energy differences can be obtained using fewer \textgreek{l}-states. We demonstrate that Simpson's rule can be used advantageously with nonequidistant values of the abscissa, which increases the flexibility of the method. Efficiency is enhanced even further if higher order methods, such as Gauss-Legendre, Gauss-Kronrod-Patterson, or Clenshaw-Curtis integration, are used; no more than seven \textgreek{l}-states, which in the case of Clenshaw-Curtis integration include the physical end states, were required for accurate results in all test problems studied. Thus, the performance of thermodynamic integration can equal that of Bennett's acceptance ratio method. We also show, however, that the high efficiency found here relies on the particular functional form of the soft-core potential used; overall, thermodynamic integration is more susceptible to the details of the hybrid Hamiltonian used than Bennett's acceptance ratio method. Therefore, we recommend Bennett's acceptance ratio method as the most robust method to compute alchemical free energy differences; nevertheless, scenarios when thermodynamic integration may be preferable are discussed.},

@article{Cournia.2017,
 abstract = {Accurate in silico prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities has been a primary objective of structure-based drug design for decades due to the putative value it would bring to the drug discovery process. However, computational methods have historically failed to deliver value in real-world drug discovery applications due to a variety of scientific, technical, and practical challenges. Recently, a family of approaches commonly referred to as relative binding free energy (RBFE) calculations, which rely on physics-based molecular simulations and statistical mechanics, have shown promise in reliably generating accurate predictions in the context of drug discovery projects. This advance arises from accumulating developments in the underlying scientific methods (decades of research on force fields and sampling algorithms) coupled with vast increases in computational resources (graphics processing units and cloud infrastructures). Mounting evidence from retrospective validation studies, blind challenge predictions, and prospective applications suggests that RBFE simulations can now predict the affinity differences for congeneric ligands with sufficient accuracy and throughput to deliver considerable value in hit-to-lead and lead optimization efforts. Here, we present an overview of current RBFE implementations, highlighting recent advances and remaining challenges, along with examples that emphasize practical considerations for obtaining reliable RBFE results. We focus specifically on relative binding free energies because the calculations are less computationally intensive than absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations and map directly onto the hit-to-lead and lead optimization processes, where the prediction of relative binding energies between a reference molecule and new ideas (virtual molecules) can be used to prioritize molecules for synthesis. We describe the critical aspects of running RBFE calculations, from both theoretical and applied perspectives, using a combination of retrospective literature examples and prospective studies from drug discovery projects. This work is intended to provide a contemporary overview of the scientific, technical, and practical issues associated with running relative binding free energy simulations, with a focus on real-world drug discovery applications. We offer guidelines for improving the accuracy of RBFE simulations, especially for challenging cases, and emphasize unresolved issues that could be improved by further research in the field.},

@article{Fleck.2021,
 abstract = {In calculations of relative free energy differences, the number of atoms of the initial and final states is rarely the same. This necessitates the introduction of dummy atoms. These placeholders interact with the physical system only by bonded energy terms. We investigate the conditions necessary so that the presence of dummy atoms does not influence the result of a relative free energy calculation. On the one hand, one has to ensure that dummy atoms only give a multiplicative contribution to the partition function so that their contribution cancels from double-free energy differences. On the other hand, the bonded terms used to attach a dummy atom (or group of dummy atoms) to the physical system have to maintain it in a well-defined position and orientation relative to the physical system. A detailed theoretical analysis of both aspects is provided, illustrated by 24 calculations of relative solvation free energy differences, for which all four legs of the underlying thermodynamic cycle were computed. Cycle closure (or lack thereof) was used as a sensitive indicator to probing the effects of dummy atom treatment on the resulting free energy differences. We find that a naive (but often practiced) treatment of dummy atoms results in errors of up to kBT when calculating the relative solvation free energy difference between two small solutes, such as methane and ammonia. While our analysis focuses on the so-called single topology approach to set up alchemical transformations, similar considerations apply to dual topology, at least many widely used variants thereof.},

 abstract = {Free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have seen a tremendous growth in the last decade. However, it is still difficult and tedious to set them up in an automated manner, as the majority of the present-day MD simulation packages lack that functionality. Relative free energy calculations are a particular challenge for several reasons, including the problem of finding a common substructure and mapping the transformation to be applied. Here we present a tool, alchemical-setup.py, that automatically generates all the input files needed to perform relative solvation and binding free energy calculations with the MD package GROMACS. When combined with Lead Optimization Mapper (LOMAP;~Liu et al. in J Comput Aided Mol Des 27(9):755-770, 2013), recently developed in our group, alchemical-setup.py allows fully automated setup of relative free energy calculations in GROMACS. Taking a graph of the planned calculations and a mapping, both computed by LOMAP, our tool generates the topology and coordinate files needed to perform relative free energy calculations for a given set of molecules, and provides a set of simulation input parameters. The tool was validated by performing relative hydration free energy calculations for a handful of molecules from the SAMPL4 challenge (Mobley et al. in J Comput Aided Mol Des 28(4):135-150, 2014). Good agreement with previously published results and the straightforward way in which free energy calculations can be conducted make alchemical-setup.py a promising tool for automated setup of relative solvation and binding free energy calculations.},

To calculate the solvation free energy of a simple ion, it is essential to take into account the polarization of nearby solvent but also the electrostatic potential drop across the liquid-gas boundary, however distant. The latter does not exist in a simulation model based on periodic boundary conditions because there is no physical boundary to the system. An important consequence is that the reference value of the electrostatic potential is not an ion in a vacuum. Also, in an infinite system, the electrostatic potential felt by a perturbing charge is conditionally convergent and dependent on the choice of computational conventions. Furthermore, with Ewald lattice summation and tinfoil conducting boundary conditions, the charges experience a spurious shift in the potential that depends on the details of the simulation system such as the volume fraction occupied by the solvent. All these issues can be handled with established computational protocols, as reviewed here and illustrated for several small ions and three solvated proteins.},

These are promising tools for lead optimization in drug discovery, computing changes in binding free energy due to modifications of a lead compound. However, in the {\textquotedbl}alchemical{\textquotedbl} framework for RBFE calculations, some types of mutations have the potential to introduce error into the computed binding free energies. Here we explore the magnitude of this error in several different model binding calculations. We find that some of the calculations involving ring breaking have significant errors, and these errors are especially large in bridged ring systems. Since the error is a function of ligand strain, which is unpredictable in advance, we believe that ring breaking should be avoided when possible.},

 abstract = {Alchemical free energy calculations are an increasingly important modern simulation technique to calculate free energy changes on binding or solvation. Contemporary molecular simulation software such as AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, and SOMD include support for the method. Implementation details vary among those codes, but users expect reliability and reproducibility, i.e., for a given molecular model and set of force field parameters, comparable free energy differences should be obtained within statistical bounds regardless of the code used. Relative alchemical free energy (RAFE) simulation is increasingly used to support molecule discovery projects, yet the reproducibility of the methodology has been less well tested than its absolute counterpart. Here we present RAFE calculations of hydration free energies for a set of small organic molecules and demonstrate that free energies can be reproduced to within about 0.2 kcal/mol with the aforementioned codes. Absolute alchemical free energy simulations have been carried out as a reference. Achieving this level of reproducibility requires considerable attention to detail and package-specific simulation protocols, and no universally applicable protocol emerges. The benchmarks and protocols reported here should be useful for the community to validate new and future versions of software for free energy calculations.},

The hallmark of these methods is the use of {\textquotedbl}bridging{\textquotedbl} potential energy functions representing \emph{alchemical} intermediate states that cannot exist as real chemical species. The data collected from these bridging alchemical thermodynamic states allows the efficient computation of transfer free energies (or differences in transfer free energies) with orders of magnitude less simulation time than simulating the transfer process directly. While these methods are highly flexible, care must be taken in avoiding common pitfalls to ensure that computed free energy differences can be robust and reproducible for the chosen force field, and that appropriate corrections are included to permit direct comparison with experimental data. In this paper, we review current best practices for several popular application domains of alchemical free energy calculations, including relative and absolute small molecule binding free energy calculations to biomolecular targets.},

Here, we find that the presence of multiple metastable ligand orientations can cause convergence problems when distance restraints alone are used. We demonstrate that the use of orientational restraints can greatly accelerate the convergence of these calculations. However, even with this acceleration, we find that sufficient sampling requires substantially longer simulations than are used in many published protocols. To further accelerate convergence, we introduce a new method of configuration space decomposition by orientation which reduces required simulation lengths by at least a factor of 5 in the cases examined. Our method is easily parallelizable, well suited for cases where a ligand cocrystal structure is not available, and can utilize initial orientations generated by docking packages.},

 abstract = {The calculation of binding free energies of charged species to a target molecule is a frequently encountered problem in molecular dynamics studies of (bio-)chemical thermodynamics. Many important endogenous receptor-binding molecules, enzyme substrates, or drug molecules have a nonzero net charge. Absolute binding free energies, as well as binding free energies relative to another molecule with a different net charge will be affected by artifacts due to the used effective electrostatic interaction function and associated parameters (e.g., size of the computational box). In the present study, charging contributions to binding free energies of small oligoatomic ions to a series of model host cavities functionalized with different chemical groups are calculated with classical atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. Electrostatic interactions are treated using a lattice-summation scheme or a cutoff-truncation scheme with Barker-Watts reaction-field correction, and the simulations are conducted in boxes of different edge lengths. It is illustrated that the charging free energies of the guest molecules in water and in the host strongly depend on the applied methodology and that neglect of correction terms for the artifacts introduced by the finite size of the simulated system and the use of an effective electrostatic interaction function considerably impairs the thermodynamic interpretation of guest-host interactions. Application of correction terms for the various artifacts yields consistent results for the charging contribution to binding free energies and is thus a prerequisite for the valid interpretation or prediction of experimental data via molecular dynamics simulation. Analysis and correction of electrostatic artifacts according to the scheme proposed in the present study should therefore be considered an integral part of careful free-energy calculation studies if changes in the net charge are involved.},

@article{Rocklin.2013,
 abstract = {The calculation of a protein-ligand binding free energy based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations generally relies on a thermodynamic cycle in which the ligand is alchemically inserted into the system, both in the solvated protein and free in solution. The corresponding ligand-insertion free energies are typically calculated in nanoscale computational boxes simulated under periodic boundary conditions and considering electrostatic interactions defined by a periodic lattice-sum. This is distinct from the ideal bulk situation of a system of macroscopic size simulated under non-periodic boundary conditions with Coulombic electrostatic interactions. This discrepancy results in finite-size effects, which affect primarily the charging component of the insertion free energy, are dependent on the box size, and can be large when the ligand bears a net charge, especially if the protein is charged as well. This article investigates finite-size effects on calculated charging free energies using as a test case the binding of the ligand 2-amino-5-methylthiazole (net charge +1 e) to a mutant form of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase in water. Considering different charge isoforms of the protein (net charges -5, 0, +3, or +9 e), either in the absence or the presence of neutralizing counter-ions, and sizes of the cubic computational box (edges ranging from 7.42 to 11.02 nm), the potentially large magnitude of finite-size effects on the raw charging free energies (up to 17.1 kJ mol(-1)) is demonstrated. Two correction schemes are then proposed to eliminate these effects, a numerical and an analytical one. Both schemes are based on a continuum-electrostatics analysis and require performing Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) calculations on the protein-ligand system. While the numerical scheme requires PB calculations under both non-periodic and periodic boundary conditions, the latter at the box size considered in the MD simulations, the analytical scheme only requires three non-periodic PB calculations for a given system, its dependence on the box size being analytical. The latter scheme also provides insight into the physical origin of the finite-size effects. These two schemes also encompass a correction for discrete solvent effects that persists even in the limit of infinite box sizes. Application of either scheme essentially eliminates the size dependence of the corrected charging free energies (maximal deviation of 1.5 kJ mol(-1)). Because it is simple to apply, the analytical correction scheme offers a general solution to the problem of finite-size effects in free-energy calculations involving charged solutes, as encountered in calculations concerning, e.g., protein-ligand binding, biomolecular association, residue mutation, pKa and redox potential estimation, substrate transformation, solvation, and solvent-solvent partitioning.},

Using several combinations of softness parameters and the \textgreek{l} power dependence, it is shown that these benefits are strongly dependent on the shape of the integrand. Although TI is more user-friendly due to its simplicity, it was found that Bennett's acceptance ratio method is the more efficient method.

The estimator, which we call the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (MBAR) because it reduces to the Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (BAR) when only two states are considered, has significant advantages over multiple histogram reweighting methods for combining data from multiple states. It does not require the sampled energy range to be discretized to produce histograms, eliminating bias due to energy binning and significantly reducing the time complexity of computing a solution to the estimating equations in many cases. Additionally, an estimate of the statistical uncertainty is provided for all estimated quantities. In the large sample limit, MBAR is unbiased and has the lowest variance of any known estimator for making use of equilibrium data collected from multiple states. We illustrate this method by producing a highly precise estimate of the potential of mean force for a DNA hairpin system, combining data from multiple optical tweezer measurements under constant force bias.},
